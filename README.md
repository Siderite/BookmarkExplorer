Open a zillion tabs in Chrome, from your favourite news sites, social media, blogs, etc. Your computer memory is gone, the hard drive is slow as hell and you wonder what to do when you actually want to just read your sites, one after the other. Enter Bookmark Explorer! You can now bookmark all tabs in a folder, close all tabs except the first and read your news. When you are ready to move on to the next news item either click on the extension button and then go forward or backward, either right click on the page and go to the context menu or just press the Ctrl-Shift-K/L combinations.

From version 1.1 a new feature lets you see all the bookmarks in the folder and select/delete any of them.

Have fun and let me know what you think!
