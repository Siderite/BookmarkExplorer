*- chrome onbookmarkdeleted doesn't work for more items at the same time!!
*- store deleted bookmarks no matter how deletes them
*- configure time to wait for a page to close before creating bookmark
*- notify when reaching the beginning or end of the bookmark folder with keyboard shortcuts
*- information about stored data size
*- don't delete and add bookmarks, just don't add them
*- mention that Bookmark Explorer does not connect to a web server
*- mention that uninstalling and installing the extension removes deleted items
*- store time of deletion of a bookmark
*- auto remove deleted bookmarks after a set time?
*- have multiple configurable folders when adding to them to read later
#- store parent name when deleting bookmarks
?- use sync instead of local storage (configurable)
- icons for various sizes and DPIs 16,32,48,64,128
*- menu for Read link later should appear on links only, another should say "Read this page later" in any other case
- select a piece of a page and bookmark it somehow, perhaps personal notes as well
- for version 3, separate the extension into separately testable modules
*- redesign the menu: two icons for toggle all/previous and structure the menu as: Delete, Restore and export/import page
- create a better export/import page, with options for saving the bookmarks as html, url text list, Chrome bookmarks file, etc. as well as importing from several formats
?- create web page from selected items (drag and drop to reorder)
- read later all tabs in window
#- setting for recursive (in folder) navigation
- option to show the manage list while browsing
