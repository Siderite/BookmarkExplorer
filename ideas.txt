*- chrome onbookmarkdeleted doesn't work for more items at the same time!!
*- store deleted bookmarks no matter how deletes them
*- configure time to wait for a page to close before creating bookmark
*- notify when reaching the beginning or end of the bookmark folder with keyboard shortcuts
*- information about stored data size
*- don't delete and add bookmarks, just don't add them
*- mention that Bookmark Explorer does not connect to a web server
*- mention that uninstalling and installing the extension removes deleted items
*- store time of deletion of a bookmark
*- auto remove deleted bookmarks after a set time?
*- have multiple configurable folders when adding to them to read later
*- menu for Read link later should appear on links only, another should say "Read this page later" in any other case
*- redesign the menu: two icons for toggle all/previous and structure the menu as: Delete, Restore and export/import page
*- have Read Page Later functionality disabled by default. One can just bookmark it with Ctrl-D.
*- show the number of items in Read Later folder(s) or active folder for the current link
*- bug: URLs ending with ? are not considered URLs resulting in an error in background page
*- bug: in some unclear situations (multiple screens? some offending third party) chrome.tabs.query with currentWindow or lastFocusedWindow returns nothing, while without may return multiple results.
*- idea: select all duplicates in the Read Later folder
*- idea: lock the Manager on a specific folder (Autoselect function that one can disable?)
*- FR: when finding duplicates, use the last bookmarked page to find the best next link
*- FR: settings to turn off various notifications
	*- duplicates
	*- go to next bookmarked page prompt
*- Advanced settings section, coming with warning
*- lower the importance of https/http differences
*- provide a way to remove duplicates
*- clean URLs of marketing parameters
*- skip feature: move bookmark at the end of the folder and advance to the next item
*- Feature request: URLs like these http://eac-codecollab2.eac.ad.ea.com/ui#review:id=106941 appear as duplicates. Let the user configure what is considered duplicate.
*- bug: page down and up in bookmark list should work like arrows
*- warn about duplicates in the folder in Manage
*- only show duplicate button when there are duplicates / use a warning color
*- icon for the menu items
*- periodically notify users about leaving feedback about the explorer on the blog page
*- revamp notifications
*- add move bookmark to start/end in manage
*- bug: close notification when choosing to never show it again

#- store parent name when deleting bookmarks
#- select a piece of a page and bookmark it somehow, perhaps personal notes as well
#- setting for recursive (in folder) navigation
#- encrypted tabs
#- tab managing interface
#- bug: duplicate bookmarks following each other block the advance of the reading
#- use sync instead of local storage (configurable)
#- create web page from selected items (drag and drop to reorder)
#- synchronize bookmarks for Read Later across devices
#- a read and delete bookmark sort of navigation
#- bug: if you change the key bindings, the title of the menu item doesn't reflect it

?- read later all tabs in window
?- option to show the manage list while browsing
?- what about tabs that people want to persist? Keep them as reference?

- icons for various sizes and DPIs 16,32,48,64,128
- for version 3, separate the extension into testable modules
- create a better export/import page, with options for saving the bookmarks as html, url text list, Chrome bookmarks file, etc. as well as importing from several formats
- bug: next bookmark takes the last bookmark in list (if there are duplicates), instead of the first - this leads to maybe deleting a lot of unread items if not careful
- bug: sometimes tabs fail to autoclose. Is it because I closed the window that started the process? Does it mean BE needs to stay MORE in the background somehow? Or is it linked to pages with no favico?
- check the extension looks good on all browser themes (use relative colors)
*- bug: get bookmarks URLs gives all URLs, not just the selected ones
*- bug: copy/paste modal doesn't close with Esc
*- bug: on Firefox, opening Manage/Settings doesn't close the popup
- exported URLs should be cleaned, even if the bookmarks URLs are not
- Shift-Space for selecting multiple bms
- notify url cleaning updates
*- Manage page - hide buttons until they are enabled
- bug: weird alignment with list items in Firefox when moving with the keyboard
- use the history API to go to urls that are in the history list (like emulating the back button when going to the previous bookmark)
- feature: move bookmark in another folder, then proceed to the next item from this folder
- domain register options (.com .net, etc)
- use await/async in the code
- option to clear selected items in the Deleted list rather than restore them
- bug: clear all data from the deleted items does not refresh the header

Ideas for speed improvements:
- compareUrls
#	- different method (either simpler Regex or another algorithm)
*	- getComparisonOptions is slowing it down (cache for urls, on setSettings clear cache)

Firefox:
*- keyboard shortcuts
	*- the text should be changed
*- getIconForUrl
*- getOptionsUrl
*- getExtensionUrl
*- notifications 
*	- options requireInteraction only in Chrome
*	- buttons only in Chrome
*- tabs
*	- query doesn't support internal extension URLs.
*- look for "chrome:"

- Manage links should not select the file if clicked
- new Chrome seems to ignore suggested_key
- change keyboard shortcut text for new Chrome
- bug: select duplicate bookmarks not disappearing after deleting duplicates
- quick actions, like "these are not duplicates" or "demo" or other context menu actions
- random mode (randomize folder items)
- a setting to disable duplicate warnings
